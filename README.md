# tensorflow_speech_recognition_
This is my first time training a neural net on a classification task and speech
recognition inspired me to do so, should be a great learning experience.

Usage
===========

Run the following code in terminal. This will take a couple hours to train fully.
If you train it from scratch, if you clone it to your computer and run it as is
it will load the saved model of the weights and bias and spit out the accuracy score.

`python run_model.py`

Model Performance
===========

After 3000 epochs the model has about 93% accuracy. It might get better
performance if I keep training it but 3000 was around 3 hours of training time
and I was happy with the performance.

all his doing.
